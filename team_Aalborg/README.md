# OECD STI hackathon general task description

Below the general desacription of the task posed to us.

## Our task

To what extent can we identify distinct instruments and country policy goals that reflect a novel co-creation approach vs. a more traditional knowledge-transfer approach?

### Description

You could use keywords to delineate a 'novel co-creation' approach from a 'traditional
knowledge transfer' approach, e.g.

* Co-creation: ‘joint’, longer time period (e.g. institutional), involvement of different actors (e.g. including civil society)
* Knowledge transfer: based on contracts, short-term, university-industry based
  * STIP Compass has a thematic portal dedicated to this topic, which offers further insights on these definitions: https://stip.oecd.org/knowledge-transfer/
  * Analysis could be extended to the Covid Watch policy data to explore whether the
Covid-19 response initiatives are particularly characteristic of a co-creation approach?
* [Keyword Data:](https://github.com/AI-Growth-Lab/OECD_hackathon/blob/main/data/keyword_data_new.csv) provides a list of categorized keywords presented in the 'Tag' column in STIP Compass. The keywords have been assigned a category (Co-creation, Knowledge Transfer, Neutral) based on the weight given in STIP Compass. This data is used for triangulation with TIP Strategies and STI Scoreboard. 

### Possible data: Inspiration

* TIP Strategies (Python folder):
  * Example keywords: knowledge_transfer, co-creation, commercialisation, technology_transfer, clusters, intellectual_property
* STIP Compass (R folder):
  * Collaborative research and innovation (TH42, 537 policies); Commercialisation of public research (TH, 314 policies); Cluster policies (TH47, 278 policies); Intellectual property rights in public research (TH46, 163 policies); Intersectoral mobility (TH44, 113 policies); Transfer and linkage strategies (TH41, 183 policies)
* STI.Scoreboard (R folder):
  * HERD/GOVERD financed by firms; innovative firms cooperating with HEIs and PRIs; ...
